# Market Research Cluster Analysis

## Report Outline

Business Case: Looking for an efficient, statistically sound approach to uncovering latent market segments.

Ultimate goal is to find an easy way to classify someone with as few variables as possible (minimizing the number of variables required to classify them)
The data could be obtained through surveys, focus groups, web sources, etc.  The point is, it's data showing how people react to certain stimuli.
We use that data to identify groups in the marketplace.

Ultimate final final goal: We were able to use two major variables to understand people, and now we can use the other 34 variables that describe the cluster.



## Introduction
Interpreting consumer product market research data can be a daunting task.  Researchers may collect user input on dozens of variables, and then it is up to analysts to interpret and generalize those results into meaningful market segments and actionable insights.  The goal of this project has been to create a repeatable, efficient, and technically sound approach to uncovering latent market segments from market research data and to identify variables that are most influential in defining those market segments so marketing and product development teams can more efficiently reach their target audiences.

The final deliverable of this project is a [web application](http://example.com) where end-users can upload their datasets for analysis and receive clustered results as well as a ranked list of the most influential variables.  The latest classification model has achieved a 90.57% accuracy, compared to just 61.94% accuracy through random classification.

## An Example
Do we want to include an example here?

## Data
The data collected in these experiments is formatted in a specific and consistent way, which includes an anonymized participant ID, a baseline constant, and columns for each of the tested variables (aka stimuli).

## Analysis
The analysis for this tool is comprised of three major components: Factor Analysis, Clustering, and Classification.
